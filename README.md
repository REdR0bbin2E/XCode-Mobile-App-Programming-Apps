# XCode-Mobile-App-Programming-Apps
Back in high school, I had the opportunity to take a Mobile App Programming course at my school district's Career Technology Education Center (CTEC). This was my first real exposure to developing mobile apps, and it sparked a passion that still drives me today.

During the course, I learned how to navigate macOS’s Xcode development environment and write applications using Swift, Apple’s native programming language. I spent time building UI components, exploring app architecture, and getting comfortable with debugging and testing apps on iOS simulators.

This early hands-on experience laid the foundation for my ongoing interest in mobile development. It gave me the confidence to start building my own projects and explore how software can shape everyday experiences through apps. That initial spark at CTEC continues to inspire me as I push deeper into mobile innovation today.
